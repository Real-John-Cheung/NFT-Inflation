# NFT-Inflation
The idea is to create a NFT that is linked to a picture of a QR code, when the NFT is sold and the QR code is scanned, a new QR code derived from it will be generated and minted in the market. When the new NFT is sold and the new QR code is scanned, the same process will be triggered.

This is the repo for the website and (maybe) the heroku app
